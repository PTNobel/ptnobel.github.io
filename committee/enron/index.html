      <p>Dear Delegates, welcome to the Enron Scandal Committee of 2000! My name is Leila Hooshyar, and I am enthused to be serving as your Head Chair for this Committee at UCBMUN XXIII. I am a Junior at U.C. Berkeley double majoring in Political Science and Society &amp; Environment (yes, the second one is a single major). Here at Cal I have joined many different clubs and organizations, like student government, the Berkeley Political Review, and Political Computer Science. Of all these organizations, UCBMUN is by far my favorite! My high school did not have Model United Nations, so it was an entirely new experience for me coming into college. I could not have made a better decision to join my second semester of freshman year, as MUN has provided me with some of my most valuable connections and leadership skills that have helped me take advantage of other opportunities throughout my college career. I was born and raised in West Virginia and came to California for school. At Cal, I have been in many undergraduate research positions and developed an interest in techniques of state-building and military intervention. These experiences have molded my interest towards possibly pursuing a Master's or Ph.D. in Political Science. This year will be my first time as a Head Chair and I could not be more excited! The Committee topic is sure to take us down some interesting pathways and I am thrilled to watch all of you try to prevent (or exacerbate) one of the greatest bankruptcy scandals of history!</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Leila Hooshyar<br>
Head Chair</p>

      <p>Esteemed delegates, welcome to UCBMUN XXIII! It is crucial that we all fully analyze and engage with important social, political, and economic issues that transcend time and effect modern societal interactions. The Enron Scandal has remained an integral part of global economic policy today and  still effects current political exchanges. Thus, it is my honor and privilege to explore this topic with all of you. My name is Pranav Mallampalli; I am a freshman an intending to major in political science and data science. At 18 years old, I am unsure of what I want to pursue in my time here at Berkeley. However, coming into my first semester here, one thing was certain: Model UN was a program that I wanted to continue from high school career. My interests have always been centered on politics as well as public policy. This further influenced my passion for economics as well as other policy oriented topics such as social justice, poverty, and international relations. With another four years of college left, I feel inclined to study and explore everything the university offers, from taking classes in artificial intelligence to dedicating a part of my time to working with underprivileged children in the field of education. Outside of my academic interests, I love catching up on my favorite TV shows (Game of Thrones: the NEW SEASON &amp; the Big Bang Theory) and I also enjoy going to the gym every day. I love watching football, basketball, tennis, and especially soccer. I hope to meet all of you at conference!</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Pranav Mallampalli<br>
Head Chair</p>
