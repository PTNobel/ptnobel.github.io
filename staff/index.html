          <p>My name is Tanner Yamada, and I am a senior at UC Berkeley majoring in chemical engineering and minoring in electrical engineering and computer science. I hail from the perpetually warm and sunny Manhattan Beach, just to the south of LAX. I participated in Model UN for four years in high school, and it remained a large part of my life in college. I have traveled extensively with UCBMUN’s competitive team, and I served as head delegate for two years. In the very small amount of time that I do not spend on classes or MUN, I enjoy playing flute in UC Berkeley’s orchestra, sleeping, eating, and arguing with my housemates.</p>

          <p>Maeve is a third-year from Vermont studying Global Studies with a minor in Spanish. She joined UCBMUN in Fall 2018 with no prior experience in MUN and is so glad that she did! UCBMUN has been an amazing experience and Maeve has loved learning and growing as part of this club. Her high school didn’t have a MUN team, so she is glad to have found such an amazing one in college and hopes to help high school students attending this conference expand their love of all things MUN. She is so excited to be your DG for the first ever BearMUN, and can’t wait to see you all in the Fall!</p>

          <p>Carol is a second-year from Irvine and Shanghai, planning to double major in Interdisciplinary Studies and Computer Science. She joined UCBMUN in her freshman year where she found a loving family and a passion in International Relations. Enjoying design and video production in her spare time, she is looking forward to using her passion to present the MUN experience to high school students and capture the amazing moments in and out of conference. MUN is one of her best experiences in college so far, and she would love to welcome you to the world of college-level MUN.</p>

          <p>Sydney Kend is a second-year at UC Berkeley intending to major in Business Administration and Global Studies. From New Canaan, CT, Sydney was recruited to the D1 rowing team at Cal. Even though you’ll find Sydney training most of the time, she continues her passion for global affairs, sparked by her high school MUN team, at university with UCBMUN. Sydney is really looking forward to serving delegates as Chief of Staff External at the first ever Bear MUN conference.</p>

          <p>Ali Hasan is a second-year from Indiana studying political science and philosophy. He has been involved in Model UN for five years in both the high school and college circuit. In high school, he helped create the first high school-hosted conference in his area and competed in GA, SB, and crisis committees. As a part of UCBMUN, he has attended TrojanMUN, AggieMUN, and LAMUN, and is your Chief of Staff Internal. Having worked on crisis committees as both a delegate and chair, he gained an appreciation for the skill and creativity contributed from everyone involved. He hopes to make crisis and directive-based committees at BearMUN an exciting and enjoyable part of the conference for everyone!</p>
