<p>You are cordially invited to Parth Nobel’s defense (aka Oral
Exam).</p>
<p><strong>March 17, 2pm Pacific</strong></p>
<p>Location: Packard Electrical Engineering Room 202 at Stanford<br />

<p>Title: Prediction error estimates via randomization and
differentiable convex optimization</p>
<p>Abstract: Measuring how accurate estimators will be on test data,
<em>i.e.</em> the prediction error (PE), is a fundamental problem in
evaluating and selecting estimators. The classically tractable
techniques either rely on setting data aside solely for evaluation or
are inconsistent in high dimensions. In this talk, we review PE
estimates that depend on the derivatives of the process by which an
estimator’s model is trained, <em>e.g.</em>, Stein’s Unbiased Risk
Estimate (SURE) and Approximate Leave-One-out (ALO), and then present
tractable algorithms for evaluating the PE estimates on models fit via
convex optimization. While these tractable algorithms are randomized,
experiments show that the randomness is inconsequential to choosing an
estimator based on the PE. This enables more data efficient estimator
selection enabling reliable estimator selection for applications where
data are difficult to collect.</p>
<h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>
<h2 id="may-i-come-in-person">May I come in-person?</h2>
<p>Of course! We will even have snacks available before the event for
in-person attendees. No need to wear anything special; most attendees
will be Stanford students and faculty going about their day.</p>
<h2 id="may-i-ask-a-question">May I ask a question?</h2>
<p>Of course! There will be time for public questions at the end of the
talk before the private portion of the examination. In general, only the
examiners may interrupt with questions.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-is-it">How long is it?</h2>
<p>The public portion should be an hour. After that there will be a
private portion for just Parth and the examiners for another hour. We
will know if Parth passed following the committee’s deliberations that
day.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-call-parth-doctor-after-it">Can I call Parth doctor after
it?</h2>
<p>Absolutely not. Stanford, unlike many other institutions, requires
that Parth defend his dissertation before his dissertation committee
approves it. Parth accordingly will not have a PhD until he finishes the
next step of getting his dissertation written and approved. This will
hopefully be in September.</p>
