You are cordially invited to Parth Nobel's dissertation defense (aka Oral Exam).

**March 17, 2pm Pacific**

Location: Packard Electrical Engineering Room 202 at Stanford

Title: Prediction error estimates via randomization and differentiable convex optimization

Abstract: Measuring how accurate estimators will be on test data, *i.e.* the prediction error (PE), is a fundamental problem in evaluating and selecting estimators. The classically tractable techniques either rely on setting data aside solely for evaluation or are inconsistent in high dimensions. In this talk, we review PE estimates that depend on the derivatives of the process by which an estimator's model is trained, *e.g.*, Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE) and Approximate Leave-One-out (ALO), and then present tractable algorithms for evaluating the PE estimates on models fit via convex optimization. While these tractable algorithms are randomized, experiments show that the randomness is inconsequential to choosing an estimator based on the PE. This enables more data efficient estimator selection enabling reliable estimator selection for applications where data are difficult to collect.

# FAQ

## May I come in-person?

Of course! We will even have snacks available before the event for in-person attendees. No need to wear anything special; most attendees will be Stanford students and faculty going about their day.

## May I ask a question?

Of course! There will be time for public questions at the end of the talk before the private portion of the examination.
In general, only the examiners may interrupt with questions.

## How long is it?

The public portion should be an hour. After that there will be a private portion for just Parth and the examiners for another hour.
We will know if Parth passed following the committee's deliberations that day.

## Can I call Parth doctor after it?

Absolutely not. Stanford, unlike many other institutions, requires that Parth defend his dissertation before his dissertation committee approves it.
Parth accordingly will not have a PhD until he finishes the next step of getting his dissertation written and approved.
This will hopefully be in September.
