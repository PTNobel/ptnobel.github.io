I will be at ICCOPT 2022!

# Bio

I am a PhD candidate at Stanford University working with Professors [Stephen Boyd](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/) and [Emmanuel Candès](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/) on optimization and its applications in statistics. I am supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF GRFP).

During the summer of 2022, I will be a Visiting Scholar at UC Berkeley working with [Riley Murray](https://rileyjmurray.wordpress.com/) and Professor [Michael Mahoney](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/) on randomized numerical linear algebra as part of the [BALLISTIC Project](https://www.netlib.org/lapack/lawnspdf/lawn297.pdf).

Prior to attending Stanford, I was a Regents' and Chancellor's Scholar at UC Berkeley where I earned a Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). I worked with Professor [Jaijeet Roychowdhury](https://jaijeet.github.io/jrpages/index.html) on system theory and numerical methods.

# Miscellaneous Other Writings

I occasionally did significant writing for the UC Berkeley Model UN. That work is provided below:

* [Conference on the Laws of War for the Cyber Era Background Guide](/pdfs/war.pdf) 
* [Excerpts addressing power grid infrastructure from Group of Latin American and Carribean Countries: 2020 Background Guide](/pdfs/grulac.pdf)
* [US Senate: Data Privacy Background Guide](/pdfs/data-privacy.pdf)

I also have written quick-reference theorem lists for a couple classes at Berkeley. Other people have told me they're useful. I make no guarantees about the absence or presence of typos. 

* [EE 120: Signals and Systems, Spring 2020 w/ Babak Ayazifar](/pdfs/EE120_Notes.pdf)
* [Math 123: Ordinary Differential Equations, Fall 2020 w/ Di Fang](/pdfs/math123-final-thm-list.pdf)
* [Math 185: Complex Analysis, Spring 2021 w/ Di Fang](/pdfs/math185-thm-list.pdf)
