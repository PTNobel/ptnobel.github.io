# Bio

I am a PhD student at the University of Utah working with Professor [Srikanth Iyengar](http://www.math.utah.edu/~iyengar/).
I graduated from the University of Washington in Spring 2022 with a BS in Computer Science & Mathematics.
I'm broadly interested in commutative algebra, homotopy theory, logic, and formal verification.
