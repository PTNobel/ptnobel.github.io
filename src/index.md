# Bio

I'm currently a PhD Student at Stanford University working with Professors Stephen Boyd and Emanuel Candès on optimization. I am supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF GRFP).

Prior to attending Stanford, I was a Regents' and Chancellor's Scholar at UC Berkeley where I earned a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). I did research in Professor Jaijeet Roychowdhury's Research Group, primarily on system theory, numerical methods, and Ising Machine scaling.

I was also the team Secretary and a Speech Coach for the UC Berkeley Model United Nations.

# Miscellaneous Other Writings

I occasionally did significant writing for the UC Berkeley Model UN. That work is provided below:

* [Conference on the Laws of War for the Cyber Era Background Guide](/pdfs/war.pdf) 
* [Excerpts addressing power grid infrastructure from Group of Latin American and Carribean Countries: 2020 Background Guide](/pdfs/war.pdf)
* [US Senate: Data Privacy Background Guide](/pdfs/data-privacy.pdf)

I also have written quick-reference theorem lists for a couple classes at Berkeley. Other people have told me they're useful. I make no guarantees about the absence or presence of typos. 

* [EE 120: Signals and Systems, Spring 2020 w/ Babak Ayazifar](/pdfs/EE120_Notes.pdf)
